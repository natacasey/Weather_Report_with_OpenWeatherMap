# Weather Report with OpenWeatherMap API using Python

## API
You will need to use [OpenWeatherMap description](https://openweathermap.org/current) to obtain the key. The link contains information needed to call the API.

## Project description

The goal of this project is to create a program that gets data from an open API OpenWeatherMap and presents a user with a weather report.
The user needs to specify either a zip code or a city to get the results for a specific location.
The report can be generated multiple times until a user gives a command to stop the program.

## Example of the output
